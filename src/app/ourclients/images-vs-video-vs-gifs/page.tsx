              A lot of work goes into making an image, video, or GIF, right? And you like to see your work
              bring good results. But which performs better? Wouldn&apos;t you want to save your time, energy,
              and money on putting out content on a medium that would give you the best performance?
              We&apos;re here to help you with just that!

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Story 1: Platform Preferences</h2>
            <p>
              The first thing you need to understand is that each platform, whether Facebook, Instagram,
              LinkedIn, or any other platform on social media, has its preferences and algorithms that might
              prefer one medium over the other. For instance, studies have shown that content in the form
              of an image organically shared on Instagram can reach 2x more people than that of the same
              share as a video or gif. Instagram prefers and has its algorithms designed to promote more
              image-driven content than animated ones.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Story 2: Engagement Metrics</h2>
            <p>
              When it comes to engagement, different formats perform differently across platforms.
              On Instagram, static images tend to get higher engagement rates in terms of likes and comments.
              However, videos often lead to longer view times and better retention rates. GIFs, sitting
              between these two formats, can capture attention quickly while being more lightweight than
              full videos.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Story 3: Content Purpose</h2>
            <p>
              Your choice between images, videos, and GIFs should align with your content&apos;s purpose.
              Use images for showcasing products, sharing quotes, or when you need immediate visual impact.
              Choose videos when you need to demonstrate something, tell a longer story, or create an
              emotional connection. GIFs work best for reactions, short demonstrations, or adding humor
              to your content.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Posts</h2>
            <p>
              In Instagram, we have come to understand that we can&apos;t differentiate the performance of one
              from the other. GIFs and videos are a need to publish both on videos.
              On Facebook though, research has shown us that videos perform better as it drives more views
              and engagement, a clear win for the video content. But still, the question arises: GIFs or
              Videos? Who better to answer than the Facebook platform themselves. According to the
              Facebook team, &quot;shorter videos get more complete views.&quot; And the more complete views you
              get, the higher your chances are of your content performing better.
